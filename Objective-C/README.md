Naming variables:

- ```first_name``` for plain C variable
- ```fullName``` for Objective-C variable
- ```_realName``` for private variable

Class extension strategies:

- If you want to add new instance variables to a class or override a method of a class, use __subclassing__.
- If you want to hide the implementation of a class, simplify a class's interface, or incorporate more code reuse, create a __class cluster__.
- If you want to add a method to a class, create a __class category__.
