// A year is a leap year if it is evenly divisible by 4.
// A year that is divisible by 100 is not a leap year unless it is also
// divisible by 400.

/* Algorithm:
 
 if (year is not divisible by 4) then (it is a common year)
 else if (year is not divisible by 100) then (it is a leap year)
 else if (year is not divisible by 400) then (it is a common year)
 else (it is a leap year)
