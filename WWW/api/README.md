You will need Faker from [here](https://github.com/fzaninotto/Faker). Before you can install _Faker_, you will need to setup _Composer_ first, which can be download from [here](https://getcomposer.org/download/). Follow the instruction on those websites to install them on your computer.

If you want to use _Lavarel's Eloquent ORM_, then read [this](https://laravel.com/docs/5.0/eloquent).
