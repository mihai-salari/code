### Password, Password2

A simple password generator application for watchOS.

Features:
* Generate a random password of 8 characters with combination of numbers, mixed cases letters, and special characters.

This is a pure watchOS application (for fun obviously), there's no code written for iOS yet (I will add it some days... perhaps to have the exact screen display on the phone).

Something that I might also added in future version:
* To let user select to use numbers + mixed case letters only OR numbers, mixed cases letters, and special characters (some people might not like the special characters).
    * Updated in Password2
* To let user set the length of the password (ideally between 6 ~ 8 characters, too short is not good, too long is hard to memorize).
    * After some thoughts, I think this is useless, if the user want a shorter password then it just pick those characters from the generated one enough, right?

Have fun!

### Steak

A timer application for home steak lover.

The UI should be pretty straight forward and self explained.

Features:

* Increase and decrease the weight of the meat
* Select your cooking preference, from rare, medium rare, medium to well done
* Select between metric and imperial units (basically grams or ounces?)
