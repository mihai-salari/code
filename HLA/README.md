You need to install the HLA (_High Level Assembler_) program in order to build the source here. One way to get it is by installing the HIDE (_HLA IDE_) for your Windows machine. After that you can compile the code from the Window's command prompt if you don't want to use the built-in features with the IDE.

To compile the soure code from Windows command prompt, type ```hla hello.hla```, and the executable file (```hello.exe```) will be generated accordingly.
