You need to install the HLA (_High Level Assembler_) program in order to build the source here. One way to get it is by installing the HIDE (_HLA IDE_) for your Windows machine, and compile it from the command prompt.

To compile the soure code, type ```hla hello.hla```, and executable will be generated accordingly.
