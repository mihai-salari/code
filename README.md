I keep everything (almost ;p) of my programming stuff here, some of them are related to my work, some of them are just because I have interests on it, and I have lots of fun while I am learning it. Computing is always a vast topic, whereas human life is such short and fragile, nevertheless, let's keep coding ðŸ˜€

> If you ever get stuck and you don't know how to make your program calculate something, take a piece of paper and try to write out the steps in English. Set aside the computer for a moment and think the steps through. How you would perform this calculation by hand? Once you know how to do that, converting the algorithm to code should be a piece of cake.
